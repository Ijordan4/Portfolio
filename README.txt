# Portfolio Page
Welcome to my portfolio! Ths project was to better put on display what I've learned so far as a bootcamp student to my employers. 

# Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work<br>
WHEN I load their portfolio<br>
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact<br>
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation<br>
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section<br>
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work<br>
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications<br>
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application<br>
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others<br>
WHEN I click on the images of the applications<br>
THEN I am taken to that deployed application<br>
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices<br>
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport<br>
